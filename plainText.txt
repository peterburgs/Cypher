There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow.
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place you'll feel there's no hurt or sorrow.
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place.
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me.
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong
It only cares for joyful giving.
If we try we shall see
In this bliss we cannot feel
Fear or dread
We stop existing and start living.
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
